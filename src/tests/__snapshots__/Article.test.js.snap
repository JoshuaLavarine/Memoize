      Pahlka founded Code for America, a San Francisco-based non-profit organization that aims to make government more transparent and connected. According to the Washington Post Code for America is the technology world’s equivalent of the Peace Corps or Teach for America, offering an alternative to the old, broken path of government IT. In her 2012 TED Talk, Pahlka noted that we will not be able to reinvent government unless we also reinvent citizenship.

      In May 2013 Pahlka announced she was temporarily taking the position of deputy chief technology officer for government innovation for the US government's Office of Science and Technology Policy. Her principal goal during her year at the White House was to create something more equivalent to the UK's Government Digital Service. She set in motion the creation of the United States Digital Service within the Executive Office of the President, and helped start 18F at the General Services Administration.
